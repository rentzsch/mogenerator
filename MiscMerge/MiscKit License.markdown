#MiscKit License Agreement

In this license, the **MiscKit administrator** is
[Don Yacktman][1].
([1\.][2]) The **MiscKit authors**
include any individual or organization who has contributed a
resource to the MiscKit. **MiscKit owners** are those who hold
any of the copyrights associated with the MiscKit and the
resources it contains. **Resources** are the components of the
MiscKit, such as an Objective-C (TM) object, an application,
an Objective-C (TM) category, an Interface Builder (TM) palette,
a Project Builder (TM) project, or a documentation file. In
special cases, a resource is a single .tiff, .snd, .nib,
.eps, or other file, but usually such files are component
parts of another resource.

Although the copyright for a resource remains with the author
of the resource (unless the copyright has been reassigned), the
MiscKit owners have licensed to the MiscKit administrator the
right to copy, distribute, license, and print their works. Some
of these rights are passed on to you through this license
agreement. Any resource which is a part of the MiscKit falls
under the terms of this license agreement unless explicitly
stated in the resource itself or its accompanying files. The
copyright for the MiscKit, held by the MiscKit administrator,
covers the collection or arrangement of objects which comprises
the MiscKit and any auxiliary files such as, but not limited
to, the MiscKit License Agreement, Charter, and Makefiles. The
file "[License\_Notes.rtf][3]"
explains the articles of this license
in greater detail.

Permission to copy the MiscKit, to redistribute it, and to
use it for any purpose is granted, subject to the following
restrictions and understandings:

1.  Any copy made of the MiscKit or modified versions of the
    MiscKit must include verbatim copies of this copyright and
    license notice and accompanying MiscKit charter.
    
1.  The MiscKit administrator's permission must be obtained for:
    
    1.  any large-scale distribution of the MiscKit.
        
    1.  redistribution of the MiscKit, or any parts of the MiscKit, in printed form.
        
    1.  distributing a modified version of the MiscKit. Modified versions of the MiscKit must also be plainly marked as such, with a suitable warning, and may not be misrepresented as being the original software.
        
    
1.  All materials developed as a consequence of the use of the MiscKit shall duly acknowledge such use.
    
1.  Anyone, the MiscKit administrator, a MiscKit author, or a third party is free to provide consulting and support services for the MiscKit.
    
1.  The MiscKit administrator may make changes to this license at any time, providing that a simple majority of MiscKit authors and owners agree to the changes. If a change is made, it immediately becomes binding upon all current resources of and subsequently added to the MiscKit. Changes to the license do not, however, retroactively affect previous versions or uses of the MiscKit or its resources.
    

The MiscKit administrator, MiscKit authors and owners, and
Brigham Young University make no express or implied warranty or
representation of any kind with respect to the MiscKit, including
any warranty that the MiscKit is defect- free. ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
IS HEREBY DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT WILL THE AFOREMENTIONED
PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE
OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE MISCKIT. The parties are under no
obligation to provide any services, by way of maintenance,
update, or otherwise.
