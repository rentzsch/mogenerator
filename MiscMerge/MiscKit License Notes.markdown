#MiscKit License Notes

## How the MiscKit License Agreement applies to you
In order to understand what is required in order to properly
comply with the MiscKit license, this page describes what is
expected of you. It follows the same numbering scheme as the
articles of the license, adding clarification to particular
requirements. This document is as legally binding as the license
in that it attempts to provide the proper interpretation of
the license requirements. It is not necessary that you read
this entire document, but it is probably worth the
time. Hopefully this document will answer any questions you
may have about the license. This document grants you some
permissions required by the MiscKit license so that the MiscKit
administrator does not need to be contacted to give permission
for several common uses of the MiscKit. Finally, this document
provides the reasoning behind many of the current restrictions.

Before covering the articles of the license, there are a few
consequences of the copyright scheme which should be
understood. Basically, the author retains all rights and
the copyright for a resource (unless these have been transferred
to another owner) and the owner is granting the MiscKit
permission to use the resource (the MiscKit administrator is
free to use, distribute, copy, license, and print the
resource). As consequences of this:

*   The author may distribute a resource via any means, and
    for any cost, outside of the MiscKit. Example: the owner of
    a resource is free to sell modified versions of said resource
    to anyone at any price they set. The owner can also give you
    permission to do so, if they so choose.
*   Modifications to a resource which are donated to the MiscKit
    become the property of the owner of a resource. (This is meant
    to eliminate administrative hassles.) Note that an Objective-C (TM)
    category is not considered a modification of a resource; it is
    a resource in it's own right, so if a contributor wishes to
    retain ownership, this is a possible option.
*   Ownership of a resource may be transferred to an individual
    other than the author or previous owner if a signed agreement
    between both parties exists. This is because the original author
    still retains all rights to the resource, and, more importantly,
    retains the copyright.
*   The author cannot remove a resource from the MiscKit. By
    contributing, an author has granted the rights to redistribute
    and use the resource. As part of the agreement between MiscKit
    administrator and contributor, once those rights are granted, it
    cannot be revoked. However, the author may remove support for
    the resource. In such a case, the contributed resource will
    remain in the MiscKit and one of the MiscKit authors will be
    assigned to carry on any future development and bug fixes. The
    copyright for the code will still remain with the original
    author. (In effect the MiscKit will end up being a separate
    development branch of the resource.) This provision is to
    allow authors to stop providing MiscKit support for a resource
    and transfer the responsibility without having to give up the
    copyright to the object. Because a contributor cannot remove
    a donated resource, they should make sure that they truly intend
    it to be a public resource. Basically, removing a donated
    resource is far too detrimental to the MiscKit. People who
    use the kit will come to depend upon the resources in it and
    many MiscKit resources rely upon other MiscKit
    resources. Removing a resource would most likely break
    something else in the MiscKit. Also, pulling a resource
    and then selling it to those who need it would be the height
    of rudeness. If this provision weren't included, it is feared
    that the MiscKit would become a bunch of disjoint objects
    that don't leverage off the capabilities of existing objects
    in the kit for fear of something suddenly disappearing in
    the future. In addition, people would be hesitant to use
    any object that might disappear some day, thus leaving the
    kit unused by most people It is hoped that this policy will
    provide a sense of security to everyone.
    

### Detailed Notes

1.  Software built using the MiscKit does not have this
    restriction; this restriction applies only to the MiscKit
    source code and development tools. So, if you redistribute
    MiscKit source you must supply these documents in the
    distribution. An app built with the MiscKit, containing
    MiscKit objects should not include these documents, as
    they apply to the MiscKit only.
1.  This article deals with distribution of the MiscKit
    source. An application that uses the MiscKit (ie. includes
    binary object code created from the MiscKit source code or
    contains a .nib, .tiff, etc. taken from the MiscKit) is
    only restricted by article 3\. In other words, the MiscKit
    license does not "infect" any project which makes use of
    the MiscKit.
    
    > Any redistribution of the MiscKit without the MiscKit
    > administrator's explicit permission must contain all files
    > which are in the original distribution as it originates
    > from the MiscKit administrator. Currently, the definitive
    > "original" distribution is available via anonymous ftp

    1.  A large-scale distribution is one which is mass-produced;
        in other words, any time more than 50 copies would be
        distributed. (In other words, the typical user group
        could give copies of the Misckit to members, but if they went
        to press a CD-ROM, then they need to get permission
        first.) Requiring you to ask permission is mostly to make
        sure that you have the option of distributing the latest
        version of the MiscKit and to allow us to be aware which
        versions of the kit came from a particular source, which
        makes the job of support much easier when bug reports
        come in from users. Upon contact, you will be provided
        with any newer versions of the kit and will be given the
        option to be added to a list of people who are notified
        of new releases of the MiscKit. Your product will also,
        if you wish, be added to a public listing which points
        to products which contain the MiscKit distribution. (For
        example, if you produce a CD-ROM and someone wanted a
        permanent copy of the MiscKit on CD-ROM, they would then
        be directed to your product.) In practically all
        circumstances, requested permission will be granted, but
        you are still required to obtain it from the MiscKit
        administrator first. An individual making copies for a
        friend is not required to contact the MiscKit
        administrator; restriction 2.1\. applies only to
        commercial products.
        _The MiscKit administrator hereby grants you permission
        to redistribute the complete, unmodified MiscKit via ftp,
        e-mail, or any other means of transmission over an
        electronic network._
    1.  Again, in practically all circumstances, permission will
        be granted, but you are still required to obtain it from the
        MiscKit administrator first. Because the owner of a resource's
        copyright has licensed the MiscKit administrator the rights to
        license and print the resource, the MiscKit administrator can
        transfer the license to print to you upon request. The right
        to print is not given you in the current license; you must
        request it. Note that the author of a resource can also give
        you permission to print it, so that is an alternate route which
        you may use to obtain permission.
    1.  Distributing modified versions of the MiscKit is highly
        discouraged, but some will want to do so anyway. The license
        automatically grants permission to redistribute the MiscKit
        without requesting the permission of the MiscKit administrator,
        but only for unmodified distributions, and under the
        circumstances delineated in other areas of the license, parts
        2.1\. and 2.2\. in particular. If you have altered the MiscKit
        or added to it, then part 2.3\. applies to the
        re-distribution. When you attempt to request permission under
        the terms of part 2.3\. you will be expected to give a very
        good reason for wanting to do this; contribution to the kit
        should be the norm. It would be preferred that any modifications
        to the MiscKit be forwarded to the maintainers of the MiscKit
        so that such modifications become part of the official MiscKit,
        but this is not required by this license. The warning you
        will be required to give should clearly state that modified
        versions are wholly unsupported by the MiscKit authors and
        may not be compatible with past, current, or future versions
        of the MiscKit. The license and charter which must be included
        with modified versions of the MiscKit (see article 1.) are
        both found in the official MiscKit distribution, and may not
        be modified.
        
        > Due to the rights granted by the MiscKit authors to the MiscKit
        > administrator, _the MiscKit administrator hereby grants you
        > permission to redistribute partial versions of the MiscKit
        > comprised of unchanged MiscKit resources, subject to the
        > restrictions of parts 2.1\. and 2.2\. but you must mark the
        > distribution as being incomplete_. If the resources are
        > modified, you must obtain permission to redistribute from
        > the MiscKit administrator or the original author of a
        > resource. If you wish to distribute a single resource, the
        > owner of the resource should be contacted. Some resources
        > may explicitly give permission for any type of redistribution,

1.  This acknowledgement should, in the case of a GUI
    application, be both in the application itself, either in
    the info panel or at some location in the on-line help, and
    in the printed manual, if such exists. Placing the phrase
    "**The MiscKit was used in development of this software**" in a
    help panel and the printed manual or the phrase "**Uses the
    MiscKit**" in the Info panel would be sufficient. In the
    case of a command-line application, acknowledgement should
    be placed in the README file distributed with the
    application. This restriction applies only to applications
    which use objects from the MiscKit library and palettes; no
    acknowledgement is required for applications which only make
    use of any specialized development tools (applications)
    provided with the MiscKit. Why promote the MiscKit in this
    way? So that it gets used by people! Why develop it if
    no one ever uses it? Often a developer will not buy
    objectware because "I can do that myself..." which defeats
    the whole purpose of OOP--code reuse--and so we want our
    code to be used. As a free project, this is the only kind
    of "advertising" we can afford to achieve this goal!
1.  Such activities are welcome as long as they do not
    violate this license agreement.
1.  If you are an author and/or owner, and you object
    to a proposed change, speak up or be forgotten! See the
    Charter for details on the voting process. Also, note that
    the kit must always remain free to users; changes which
    limit the freedom of users and distributors more than the
    current license are not allowed. Note that since a vote
    of all authors is required to make changes, this should
    keep itself in check quite easily.
    

### Goals of the MiscKit license agreement:
The purpose and intent of the MiscKit license is to fulfill
the following goals:

*   Allow the MiscKit to be freely distributed to as large an audience as possible.
*   Provide a kit of useful programming tools which may be used by anybody without having to pay for its use.
*   Allow programmers to contribute to a project which will aid themselves and their peers.
*   Assure that there will always be a "definitive" version of the MiscKit, distributed by the MiscKit administrator, which may be trusted. By allowing contributors, it is hoped that branches will not break off of the MiscKit, which will make the kit more useful as a whole because there will be less confusion as to which version should be used.
    

Basically, we're trying to make something which is almost
a public domain kit, but do it in a manner that is organized
and lacks the confusion of multiple incompatible versions
often seen with public domain code.
